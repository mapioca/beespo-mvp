<h2>LYRICS</h2>

<h2>Sabbath and Weekday</h2>

<h3>1001. Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</h3>
<h4>1. Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry blessing; Tune my heart to sing Thy grace. Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above. Praise the mount; I’m fixed upon it: Mount of Thy redeeming love.</h4>
<h4>2. Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I’m come. And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wand’ring from the fold of God; He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.</h4>
<h4>3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor Daily I’m constrained to be! Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love. Here’s my heart, O take and seal it; Seal it for Thy courts above.</h4>
<p>The prophet Samuel set up a great stone as a memorial to remind his people that God had saved them in battle. He called the stone “Eben-ezer,” or “stone of help.” (See 1 Samuel 7:10–12.)</p>

<h3>1002. When the Savior Comes Again</h3>
<h4>1. When the Savior comes again, He will cleanse the earth, and then In glory He will reign as King of kings among all men. Hate will cease and war will end; peace will dwell throughout the land; The wolf shall feed together with the lamb.</h4>
<p>Lift up your voice! Rejoice! And prepare for that day! Learn of the Lord and keep following His way. No one knows the day and hour when He will come again, But He’ll return as scriptures say; it will be a joyful day When our beloved Savior comes again.</p>
<h4>2. When that glorious day is here, there will be no need to fear; For Satan will be bound, and Christ will reign a thousand years. Death and pain will be no more; hidden knowledge shall come forth And ev’ry tongue confess that Christ is Lord!</h4>
<p>Lift up your voice! Rejoice! And prepare for that day! Learn of the Lord and keep following His way. No one knows the day and hour when He will come again, But He’ll return as scriptures say; it will be a joyful day When our beloved Savior comes again.</p>

<h3>1003. It Is Well with My Soul</h3>
<h4>1. When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll— Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, “It is well, it is well with my soul.”</h4>
<p>It is well with my soul; It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
<h4>2. Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control: That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</h4>
<p>It is well with my soul; It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
<h4>3. My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!— My sin, not in part but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.</h4>
<p>It is well with my soul; It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
<h4>4. O Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, The heav’ns be rolled back like a scroll. The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend; Even so, it is well with my soul.</h4>
<p>It is well with my soul; It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul spoke of the Savior “nailing [our sins] to his cross” (see Colossians 2:13–15) and offering forgiveness to all who repent.</p>

<h3>1004. I Will Walk with Jesus</h3>
<h4>1. Jesus walked in wisdom. Jesus grew in truth, Showing love to God and man while in His youth. Jesus wants to guide me. Jesus shows the way, Calling me to come and walk with Him each day.</h4>

<h3>1005. His Eye Is on the Sparrow</h3>
<h4>1. Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely And long for heav’n and home, When Jesus is my portion? My constant Friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</h4>
<p>I sing because I’m happy— I sing because I’m free— For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</p>
<h4>2. “Let not your heart be troubled.” His tender word I hear, And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubt and fear. Though by the path He leadeth, But one step I may see: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</h4>
<p>I sing because I’m happy— I sing because I’m free— For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</p>
<h4>3. Whenever I am tempted, Whenever clouds arise, When songs give place to sighing, When hope within me dies, I draw the closer to Him; From care He sets me free: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</h4>
<p>I sing because I’m happy— I sing because I’m free— For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the word “portion” refers to an inheritance (see Psalm 119:57). “Jesus is my portion” expresses our hope in an eternal inheritance with the Lord.</p>

<h4>1. Think a sacred song; the words will give you pow’r. Think the melody, and in that very hour Your heart and mind will open to let the Spirit in, And you will feel His comfort again.</h4>
<h4>2. Think a sacred song when scared or feeling bad. Hum the quiet tune whenever you are sad. Your heart and mind will open to let the Spirit in, And you will feel His comfort again.</h4>

<h3>1007. As Bread Is Broken</h3>
<h4>1. As bread is broken, we think of Thee— Thy broken body on Calvary. May we remember Thy suff’ring sore, With broken hearts Thy grace implore.</h4>
<h4>2. We drink the water in memory Of blood Thou spilt in Gethsemane. Lord, wilt Thou wash us from ev’ry stain— Our hearts and hands make clean again.</h4>
<h4>3. May our repentance now be sincere. Unto our pleadings incline Thine ear. We seek forgiveness—that gift divine— A change of heart, a change of mind.</h4>
<h4>4. Help us, dear Savior, to take Thy name, To be like Thee and Thy word proclaim. Send us Thy Spirit this Sabbath day To guide us in Thy holy way.</h4>
<p>During the Last Supper, the Savior “took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me” (1 Corinthians 11:23–24). The Savior’s flesh was broken when He was brutally scourged and nailed to the cross. But in fulfillment of prophecy, none of His bones were broken (see John 19:32–36).</p>

<h3>1009. Gethsemane</h3>
<h4>1. Jesus climbed the hill to the Garden still; His steps were heavy and slow. Love and a prayer took Him there to the place only He could go.</h4>
<p>Gethsemane! Jesus loves me, So He went willingly to Gethsemane.</p>
<h4>2. He felt all that was sad, wicked, or bad, all the pain we would ever know. While His friends were asleep, He fought to keep His promise made long ago.</h4>
<p>Gethsemane! Jesus loves me, So He went willingly to Gethsemane.</p>
<p>The hardest thing that ever was done, The greatest pain that ever was known, The biggest battle that ever was won— This was done by Jesus! The fight was won by Jesus!</p>
<p>Gethsemane! Jesus loves me, So He gave this gift to me in Gethsemane. Gethsemane! Jesus loves me, So He gives this gift to me from Gethsemane.</p>

<h3>1010. Amazing Grace</h3>
<h4>1. Amazing grace—how sweet the sound—  That saved a wretch like me!  I once was lost, but now am found,  Was blind, but now I see.</h4>
<h4>2. The Lord has promised good to me;  His word my hope secures.  He will my shield and portion be  As long as life endures.</h4>
<h4>3. Through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come.  His grace has brought me safe thus far,  And grace will lead me home.</h4>
<p>This beloved hymn reminds us of Nephi’s anguished cry: “O wretched man that I am!” Then, remembering the Lord’s mercy, Nephi added, “My soul will rejoice in thee, my God” (2 Nephi 4:17, 30). The text of this hymn was included in an early hymnbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1841.</p>

<h3>1011. Holding Hands Around the World</h3>
<h4>1. We are children singing all around the world, Happy voices ringing out the joyful word. We are children glowing with the gospel light, Standing tall, walking strong, choosing right. We are children leading out in ev’ry land Who believe in keeping all the Lord’s commands. Like the stripling warriors we go forth in faith, For we know that the Lord is our strength.</h4>

<h3>1013. God’s Gracious Love</h3>
<h4>1. Day by day, God’s gracious love surrounds me  As a balm to soothe my troubled heart.

Ev’ry day, with all its pain and pleasure,  Mingles tears with peace and rest.</h4>
<h4>2. Day by day, the Lord is ever near me,  Granting loving mercies for each hour,  And my care He gladly bears, and cheers me  With His counsel pure and holy pow’r.  I’ll not fear for what may come tomorrow,  Though the path ahead I cannot see.  He assures that in all joy or sorrow,  “As thy days, thy strength shall be.”</h4>
<h4>3. Help me rest in quiet consolation.  Help me trust Thy promises, O Lord.  When I’m faced with daily tribulation,  Help me find the strength to live Thy word.  Then, dear Lord, when toil and trouble find me,  Hold me steadfast in Thy pow’rful hand.  Day by day, Thy strength will bear me kindly  Till I reach the promised land.</h4>

<h3>1014. My Shepherd Will Supply My Need</h3>
<h4>1. My Shepherd will supply my need;  Jehovah is His name.  In pastures fresh He makes me feed  Beside the living stream.  He brings my wand’ring spirit back  When I forsake His ways  And leads me for His mercy’s sake  In paths of truth and grace.</h4>
<h4>2. When I walk through the shades of death,  Thy presence is my stay;  One word of Thy supporting breath  Drives all my fears away.  Thy hand, in sight of all my foes,  Doth still my table spread.  My cup with blessings overflows;  Thine oil anoints my head.</h4>
<h4>3. The sure provisions of my God  Attend me all my days.  O may Thy house be mine abode  And all my work be praise!  There would I find a settled rest  While others go and come—  No more a stranger nor a guest,  But like a child at home.</h4>

<h4>2. Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus— Spread His praise from shore to shore!  Praise His mercy, praise His goodness;  Praise His love forevermore.  How He watcheth o’er His loved ones,  Died to call them all His own; How for them He intercedeth,  Watcheth o’er them from His throne.</h4>
<h4>3. Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus—  Love of ev’ry love the best—  ’Tis an ocean vast of blessing;  ’Tis a haven sweet of rest.  Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus—  ’Tis a heav’n of heav’ns to me;  And it lifts me up to glory,  Lifts me up eternally.</h4>

<h3>1016. Behold the Wounds in Jesus’ Hands</h3>
<h4>1. Behold the wounds in Jesus’ hands,  The mark upon His side,  Then ponder whom He meant to save  When on the cross He died.  We cannot see the love of God,  Which saves us from the Fall,  Yet know that Christ from wood and nails  Built mansions for us all.</h4>
<h4>2. Behold the outstretched hands of Christ—  Our Lord, who came to save—  Whose love and grace redeem our souls  And lift us from the grave.  Though we are bruised whene’er we stray,  His guiding hands caress.  He washes and anoints with oil,  And in His arms we rest.</h4>
<h4>3. Behold the wounds in Jesus’ hands.  Look to your Lord and live.  He yearns to bless you with His love  And all your sins forgive.  Oh, empty is the heart of man  When it is filled with sin.  Come, open wide your broken heart  And let your Savior in!</h4>
<h4>4. Behold His wounded hands and feet!  Come touch, and see, and feel  The wounds and marks that you may know  His love for you is real.  Then as you fall to worship Him  And wash His feet with tears,  Your Savior takes you in His arms  And quiets all your fears.</h4>
<p>The words “Christ from wood and nails built mansions for us all” are a poetic expression that reminds us of the Savior’s Crucifixion and His gift of eternal life. The Lord told His disciples: “In my Father’s house are many mansions. … I go to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2).</p>

<h3>1017. This Is the Christ</h3>
<h4>1. They heard a voice, a voice so mild.  It pierced them through and made their souls to quake.  They saw Him come, a man in white,  The Savior, who had suffered for their sake.  They felt the wounds in hands and side,  And each could testify: This is the Christ.</h4>
<p>This is the Christ, the holy Son of God—  Our Savior, Lord, Redeemer of mankind.  This is the Christ, the Healer of our souls,  Who ransomed us with love divine.</p>
<h4>2. I read His words, the words He prayed  While bearing sorrow in Gethsemane.  I feel His love, the price He paid.  How many drops of blood were spilled for me?  With Saints of old in joyful cry  I too can testify: This is the Christ.</h4>
<p>This is the Christ, the holy Son of God—  Our Savior, Lord, Redeemer of mankind.  This is the Christ, the Healer of our souls,  Who ransomed us with love divine.</p>
<p>After His Resurrection, Jesus Christ visited a group of faithful people in the ancient Americas who were awaiting His prophesied appearance. Verse 1 refers to that sacred event (see 3 Nephi 11). Verse 2 describes how we feel today as we read about His great atoning sacrifice.</p>

Those marvelous Saints who embraced this great work  And shared it in lands far and near— Who gave all their heart, mind, and strength to the Lord With wisdom and vision so clear— Now stand as examples of virtue and faith,  Of souls prepared to hear, Of knowledge sure, born of humble heart,  And love that banished fear.</h4>
<p>With faith in ev’ry footstep,  We follow Christ, the Lord; And filled with hope through His pure love,  We sing with one accord.</p>
<h4>3. If we now desire to assist in this work  And thrust in our sickle with might, If we will embark in the service of God  To harvest in fields that are white, Our souls may receive the salvation of God— The fulness of His light— Then we may stand, free of sin and blame,  God’s glory in our sight.</h4>
<p>With faith in ev’ry footstep,  We follow Christ, the Lord; And filled with hope through His pure love,  We sing with one accord.</p>

<h3>1023. Standing on the Promises</h3>
<h4>1. Standing on the promises of Christ, my King, Through eternal ages let His praises ring!  Glory in the highest I will shout and sing— Standing on the promises of God.</h4>
<p>Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior; Standing, standing— I’m standing on the promises of God.</p>
<h4>2. Standing on the promises that cannot fail When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, By the living Word of God I shall prevail— Standing on the promises of God.</h4>
<p>Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior; Standing, standing— I’m standing on the promises of God.</p>
<h4>3. Standing on the promises of Christ, the Lord, Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord, Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword— Standing on the promises of God.</h4>
<p>Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior; Standing, standing— I’m standing on the promises of God.</p>
<h4>4. Standing on the promises, I cannot fall, List’ning ev’ry moment to the Spirit’s call, Resting in my Savior as my all in all— Standing on the promises of God.</h4>
<p>Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior; Standing, standing— I’m standing on the promises of God.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul exhorted us to “stand,” placing our trust in God’s promises (see Ephesians 6:13). As we keep our covenants and rely on God’s word, we will be able to withstand the perils of the latter days.</p>

<h3>1040. His Voice as the Sound</h3>
<h4>1. His voice as the sound of the dulcimer sweet Is heard through the shadow of death. The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet; The air is perfumed with His breath. His words like a fountain of righteousness flow That waters the garden of grace. The source of salvation all people shall know And bask in the smile of His face.</h4>
<h4>2. The robes of His righteousness— who can describe? Their purity words would defile. The heav’ns to His presence their beauties ascribe, And earth is made rich by His smile. The warmth of His mercy in excellence bright Shines down from His kingdom above. Like morning, He fills all creation with light And comforts His people with love.</h4>
<h4>3. He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice, And myriads wait for His word. He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice, Reechoes the praise of the Lord. Dear Shepherd, I hear and will follow Thy call; I know the sweet sound of Thy voice. Restore and protect me, for Thou art my All; In Thee I will ever rejoice.</h4>
<p>The word “dulcimer” has been used for various musical instruments. The cedar trees of Lebanon are a symbol of strength and prosperity. In verse 1 they represent the power and pride of the world, which will eventually bow before the Lord.</p>

<h4>1. O Lord, who gave Thy life for me, I come now in humility And here my sacrifice impart: A contrite soul, a broken heart. Oh, may Thy love in mercy shine And bind my sorrowing heart to Thine.</h4>
<h4>2. My burden at Thy feet I lay— My pride, my hurt, each willful way, The weight of all my sin and care— And in its place Thy yoke I’ll bear. Oh, may Thy love my soul refine And bind my trusting heart to Thine.</h4>
<h4>3. My heart is full of love for Thee, Because I know Thou first loved me. Now by that love I’ll seek to live; Like Thee, I freely would forgive. Oh, may Thy love my life define And bind my willing heart to Thine.</h4>
<h4>4. And as I strive to thus endure With cleaner hands and heart more pure, In all around I see Thy face And feel the bounties of Thy grace. O Savior, may Thy love divine Now bind my grateful heart to Thine.</h4>

<p>Come in through Him,  Into the fold of God.  Our Savior, Jesus, is the Way—  The Savior of the world.</p>
<h4>2. God’s servants, teaching in His name,  Will live His gospel strong and true,  For did not Jesus do the same?  He taught and lived it too.</h4>
<p>Come in through Him,  Into the fold of God.  Our Savior, Jesus, is the Way—  The Savior of the world.</p>
<h4>3. Our Savior is the precious tree  That bears the fruit so sweet and pure.  His truth that makes us ever free  Unchanging will endure.</h4>
<p>Come in through Him,  Into the fold of God.  Our Savior, Jesus, is the Way—  The Savior of the world.</p>
<p>This beloved hymn, written by an early Church pioneer from Tonga, invites all people to come into the fold of God through Jesus Christ, who is the Way (see John 10:7–11; 14:6).</p>

<h3>1046. Can You Count the Stars in Heaven?</h3>
<h4>1. Can you count the stars in heaven  Brightly shining in the sky?  Can you count the clouds above you,  Softly, gently floating by?  Our dear Lord, who never slumbers,  Knows them all and each one numbers.  And He knows and cares for you, And He knows and cares for you.</h4>
<h4>2. Can you count the sweet birds singing  In the sunshine through the day?  Can you count the little fishes  That in sparkling waters play?  Our dear Lord, their number knowing,  Watches all, His care bestowing.  And He will remember you, And He will remember you.</h4>
<h4>3. Can you count how many children  Kneel beside their beds at night,  Asking God to bless and keep them  Till they rise at morning light?  Our dear Lord, who lives in heaven,  Loving care to each has given.  And He loves you dearly too, And He loves you dearly too.</h4>

<h3>1047. He Cares for Me</h3>
<h4>1. He knows the stars that shine at night.  He made the burning sun.  And ev’ry creature, great or small—  He numbers ev’ry one.  He also knows my face and voice.  He loves me perfectly.  Our Heav’nly Father knows all things;  He knows and cares for me.</h4>
<h4>2. He hears the sound of ocean waves  That crash upon the shore.  And when the rain clouds fill the sky,  He hears the thunder roar.  He also hears the quiet words  I pray on bended knee.  Our Heav’nly Father hears all things;  He hears and cares for me.</h4>
<h4>3. He loves me whether I am sad  Or happy or in pain.  He understands my troubles, and  He even knows my name.  For He’s my Heav’nly Father;  His child I’ll always be.  Our Heav’nly Father loves us all;  He loves and cares for me.</h4>

<h3>1049. Joseph Prayed in Faith</h3>
<h4>1. Joseph had a question, so he read God’s word.  There he learned that he could always ask the Lord.  Joseph needed wisdom, so he knelt to pray,  Trusting God would answer him and show the way.</h4>
<h4>2. In a light above him, brighter than the sun,  Joseph saw the Father and His holy Son.  When I’m needing wisdom, I can kneel and pray. God, who answered Joseph, answers me today.</h4>
<h4>3. I may not see a vision, but I can know and feel  That God our Heav’nly Father and His Son are real.  They always love and hear me; I know this is true.  Joseph prayed in faith, and I can too.  Yes, Joseph prayed in faith, and I can too.</h4>

<h3>1203. What Child Is This?</h3>
<h4>1. What Child is this, who, laid to rest, On Mary’s lap is sleeping— Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ, the King, Whom shepherds guard, and angels sing: Haste, haste to bring Him laud, The Babe, the Son of Mary!</h4>
<h4>2. Why lies He in such mean estate, Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christians, fear, for sinners here The silent Word is pleading. Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through, The cross be borne for me, for you; Hail! Hail! the Word made flesh, The Babe, the Son of Mary!</h4>
<h4>3. So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh. Come, peasant, king, to own Him. The King of kings salvation brings; Let loving hearts enthrone Him. Raise, raise the song on high. The virgin sings her lullaby. Joy! Joy! for Christ is born, The Babe, the Son of Mary!</h4>
