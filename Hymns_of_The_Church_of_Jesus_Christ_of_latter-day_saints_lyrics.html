<h2>Restoration</h2>

<h3>1. The Morning Breaks</h3>
<h4>1. The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo, Zion’s standard is unfurled! The dawning of a brighter day, The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world.</h4>
<h4>2. The clouds of error disappear Before the rays of truth divine; The glory bursting from afar, The glory bursting from afar Wide o’er the nations soon will shine.</h4>
<h4>3. The Gentile fulness now comes in, And Israel’s blessings are at hand. Lo, Judah’s remnant, cleansed from sin, Lo, Judah’s remnant, cleansed from sin, Shall in their promised Canaan stand.</h4>
<h4>4. Jehovah speaks! Let earth give ear, And Gentile nations turn and live. His mighty arm is making bare, His mighty arm is making bare His cov’nant people to receive.</h4>
<h4>5. —Angels from heav’n and truth from earth Have met, and both have record borne; Thus Zion’s light is bursting forth, Thus Zion’s light is bursting forth To bring her ransomed children home.</h4>

<h3>3. Now Let Us Rejoice</h3>
<h4>1. Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation. No longer as strangers on earth need we roam. Good tidings are sounding to us and each nation, And shortly the hour of redemption will come, When all that was promised the Saints will be given, And none will molest them from morn until ev’n, And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden, And Jesus will say to all Israel, “Come home.”</h4>
<h4>2. We’ll love one another and never dissemble But cease to do evil and ever be one. And when the ungodly are fearing and tremble, We’ll watch for the day when the Savior will come, When all that was promised the Saints will be given, And none will molest them from morn until ev’n, And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden, And Jesus will say to all Israel, “Come home.”</h4>
<h4>3. In faith we’ll rely on the arm of Jehovah To guide thru these last days of trouble and gloom, And after the scourges and harvest are over, We’ll rise with the just when the Savior doth come. Then all that was promised the Saints will be given, And they will be crown’d with the angels of heav’n, And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden, And Christ and his people will ever be one.</h4>

<h4>2. Had we not before the gospel? Yes, it came of old to men. Then what is this latter gospel? ’Tis the first one come again. This was preached by Paul and Peter And by Jesus Christ, the Head. This we latter Saints are preaching; We their footsteps wish to tread.</h4>
<h4>3. Where so long has been the gospel? Did it pass from earth away? Yes, ’twas taken back to heaven Till should dawn a brighter day. What became of those departed, Knowing not the gospel plan? In the spirit world they’ll hear it; God is just to ev’ry man.</h4>

<h3>13. An Angel from on High</h3>

<h4>2. Sealed by Moroni’s hand, It has for ages lain To wait the Lord’s command, From dust to speak again. It shall again to light come forth To usher in Christ’s reign on earth. It shall again to light come forth To usher in Christ’s reign on earth.</h4>

<h4>1. Sweet is the peace the gospel brings To seeking minds and true. With light refulgent on its wings, It clears the human view.</h4>
<h4>2. Its laws and precepts are divine And show a Father’s care. Transcendent love and mercy shine In each injunction there.</h4>

<h4>4. May we who know the sacred Name From every sin depart. Then will the Spirit’s constant flame Preserve us pure in heart.</h4>
<h4>5. Ere long the tempter’s power will cease, And sin no more annoy, No wrangling sects disturb our peace, Or mar our heartfelt joy.</h4>
<h4>6. That which we have in part received Will be in part no more, For he in whom we all believe To us will all restore.</h4>
<h4>7. In patience, then, let us possess Our souls till he appear. On to our mark of calling press; Redemption draweth near.</h4>

<h3>15. I Saw a Mighty Angel Fly</h3>

<h4>2. He cries, and with a mighty voice; Ye nations lend an ear, And isles and continents rejoice: The great Redeemer’s near! He cries; let ev’ry ear attend, And thrones and empires all! Fear God, and make the Lord your friend, The King, the Lord of all!</h4>
<h4>3. Fear God, who made the water pure, The heavens, sea, and land. His judgment will be swift and sure; The day is nigh at hand. Then, all ye people, worship God; Give glory to his name! To spread these tidings far abroad The holy angel came.</h4>

<h3>21. Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice</h3>
<h4>1. Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, And hear the word of God, And in the way of truth rejoice, And sing for joy aloud. We’ve found the way the prophets went Who lived in days of yore. Another prophet now is sent This knowledge to restore.</h4>
<h4>2. The gloom of sullen darkness spread Thru earth’s extended space Is banished by our living Head, And God has shown his face. Thru erring schemes in days now past The world has gone astray; Yet Saints of God have found at last The straight and narrow way.</h4>
<h4>3. ’Tis not in man they put their trust Nor on his arm rely. Full well assured, all are accursed Who Jesus Christ deny. The Savior to his people saith, “Let all my words obey, And signs shall follow living faith, Down to the latest day.”</h4>
<h4>4. Then heed the words of truth and light That flow from fountains pure. Yea, keep His law with all thy might Till thine election’s sure, Till thou shalt hear the holy voice Assure eternal reign, While joy and cheer attend thy choice, As one who shall obtain.</h4>

<h4>2. In ev’ry land, in ev’ry tongue, our prophet will be heard; How swiftly round the world his voice reveals the gospel word! The sacred message that he brings will witness and agree With ev’ry prophet called of God throughout earth’s history.</h4>
<h4>3. Hosanna! Let our praise ascend unto the Savior’s throne; Rejoice! The prophet has confirmed that by Him we are known. Attend, ye earth! The prophet speaks; come listen and obey. He is the man who holds the keys of priesthood pow’r today.</h4>

<h3>25. Now We’ll Sing with One Accord</h3>
<h4>1. Now we’ll sing with one accord, For a prophet of the Lord, Bringing forth his precious word, Cheers the Saints as anciently. When the world in darkness lay, Lo! he sought the better way, And he heard the Savior say, “Go and prune my vineyard, son!”</h4>
<h4>2. And an angel surely then, For a blessing unto men, Brought the priesthood back again In its ancient purity. Even Joseph he inspired; Yea, his heart he truly fired With the light that he desired For the work of righteousness.</h4>
<h4>3. And the Book of Mormon true, With its cov’nant ever new, For the Gentile and the Jew, He translated sacredly. God’s commandments to mankind, For believing Saints designed, And to bless the seeking mind, Came to him from Jesus Christ.</h4>
<h4>4. Precious are the years to come, While the righteous gather home For the great millennium, When they’ll rest in blessedness. Prudent in this world of woes, They will triumph o’er their foes, While the realm of Zion grows Purer for eternity.</h4>

<h3>26. Joseph Smith’s First Prayer</h3>
<h4>1. Oh, how lovely was the morning! Radiant beamed the sun above. Bees were humming, sweet birds singing, Music ringing thru the grove, When within the shady woodland Joseph sought the God of love, When within the shady woodland Joseph sought the God of love.</h4>
<h4>2. Humbly kneeling, sweet appealing— ’Twas the boy’s first uttered prayer— When the pow’rs of sin assailing Filled his soul with deep despair; But undaunted, still he trusted In his Heav’nly Father’s care, But undaunted, still he trusted In his Heav’nly Father’s care.</h4>
<h4>3. Suddenly a light descended, Brighter far than noonday sun, And a shining, glorious pillar O’er him fell, around him shone, While appeared two heav’nly beings, God the Father and the Son, While appeared two heav’nly beings, God the Father and the Son.</h4>
<h4>4. “Joseph, this is my Beloved; Hear him!” Oh, how sweet the word! Joseph’s humble prayer was answered, And he listened to the Lord. Oh, what rapture filled his bosom, For he saw the living God, Oh, what rapture filled his bosom, For he saw the living God.</h4>

<h3>27. Praise to the Man</h3>
<h4>1. Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer. Blessed to open the last dispensation, Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.</h4>
<p>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain. Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren; Death cannot conquer the hero again.</p>
<h4>2. Praise to his mem’ry, he died as a martyr; Honored and blest be his ever great name! Long shall his blood, which was shed by assassins, Plead unto heav’n while the earth lauds his fame.</h4>
<p>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain. Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren; Death cannot conquer the hero again.</p>
<h4>3. Great is his glory and endless his priesthood. Ever and ever the keys he will hold. Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom, Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.</h4>
<p>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain. Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren; Death cannot conquer the hero again.</p>
<h4>4. Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven; Earth must atone for the blood of that man. Wake up the world for the conflict of justice. Millions shall know “Brother Joseph” again.</h4>
<p>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain. Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren; Death cannot conquer the hero again.</p>

<h3>29. A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief</h3>
<h4>1. A poor wayfaring Man of grief Hath often crossed me on my way, Who sued so humbly for relief That I could never answer nay. I had not pow’r to ask his name, Whereto he went, or whence he came; Yet there was something in his eye That won my love; I knew not why.</h4>
<h4>2. Once, when my scanty meal was spread, He entered; not a word he spake, Just perishing for want of bread. I gave him all; he blessed it, brake, And ate, but gave me part again. Mine was an angel’s portion then, For while I fed with eager haste, The crust was manna to my taste.</h4>
<h4>3. I spied him where a fountain burst Clear from the rock; his strength was gone. The heedless water mocked his thirst; He heard it, saw it hurrying on. I ran and raised the suff’rer up; Thrice from the stream he drained my cup, Dipped and returned it running o’er; I drank and never thirsted more.</h4>
<h4>4. ’Twas night; the floods were out; it blew A winter hurricane aloof. I heard his voice abroad and flew To bid him welcome to my roof. I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest And laid him on my couch to rest, Then made the earth my bed and seemed In Eden’s garden while I dreamed.</h4>
<h4>5. Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death, I found him by the highway side. I roused his pulse, brought back his breath, Revived his spirit, and supplied Wine, oil, refreshment—he was healed. I had myself a wound concealed, But from that hour forgot the smart, And peace bound up my broken heart.</h4>
<h4>6. In pris’n I saw him next, condemned To meet a traitor’s doom at morn. The tide of lying tongues I stemmed, And honored him ’mid shame and scorn. My friendship’s utmost zeal to try, He asked if I for him would die. The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill, But my free spirit cried, “I will!”</h4>
<h4>7. Then in a moment to my view The stranger started from disguise. The tokens in his hands I knew; The Savior stood before mine eyes. He spake, and my poor name he named, “Of me thou hast not been ashamed. These deeds shall thy memorial be; Fear not, thou didst them unto me.”</h4>

<h3>30. Come, Come, Ye Saints</h3>
<h4>1. Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear; But with joy wend your way. Though hard to you this journey may appear, Grace shall be as your day. ’Tis better far for us to strive Our useless cares from us to drive; Do this, and joy your hearts will swell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>2. Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard? ’Tis not so; all is right. Why should we think to earn a great reward If we now shun the fight? Gird up your loins; fresh courage take. Our God will never us forsake; And soon we’ll have this tale to tell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>3. We’ll find the place which God for us prepared, Far away in the West, Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; There the Saints will be blessed. We’ll make the air with music ring, Shout praises to our God and King; Above the rest these words we’ll tell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>4. And should we die before our journey’s through, Happy day! All is well! We then are free from toil and sorrow, too; With the just we shall dwell! But if our lives are spared again To see the Saints their rest obtain, Oh, how we’ll make this chorus swell— All is well! All is well!</h4>

<h4>3. In thy mountain retreat, God will strengthen thy feet; Without fear of thy foes thou shalt tread; And their silver and gold, as the prophets have told, Shall be brought to adorn thy fair head. O Zion! dear Zion! home of the free, Soon thy towers shall shine with a splendor divine, And eternal thy glory shall be.</h4>
<h4>4. Here our voices we’ll raise, and we’ll sing to thy praise, Sacred home of the prophets of God. Thy deliv’rance is nigh; thy oppressors shall die; And thy land shall be freedom’s abode.

<h3>37. The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close</h3>
<h4>1. The wintry day, descending to its close, Invites all wearied nature to repose, And shades of night are falling dense and fast, Like sable curtains closing o’er the past. Pale through the gloom the newly fallen snow Wraps in a shroud the silent earth below As tho ’twere mercy’s hand had spread the pall, A symbol of forgiveness unto all.</h4>
<h4>2. I cannot go to rest, but linger still In meditation at my windowsill, While, like the twinkling stars in heaven’s dome, Come one by one sweet memories of home. And wouldst thou ask me where my fancy roves To reproduce the happy scenes it loves, Where hope and memory together dwell And paint the pictured beauties that I tell?</h4>
<h4>3. Away beyond the prairies of the West, Where exiled Saints in solitude were blest, Where industry the seal of wealth has set Amid the peaceful vales of Deseret, Unheeding still the fiercest blasts that blow, With tops encrusted by eternal snow, The tow’ring peaks that shield the tender sod Stand, types of freedom reared by nature’s God.</h4>
<h4>4. The wilderness, that naught before would yield, Is now become a fertile, fruitful field. Where roamed at will the fearless Indian band, The templed cities of the Saints now stand. And sweet religion in its purity Invites all men to its security. There is my home, the spot I love so well, Whose worth and beauty pen nor tongue can tell.</h4>

<h3>48. Glorious Things Are Sung of Zion</h3>
<h4>1. Glorious things are sung of Zion, Enoch’s city seen of old, Where the righteous, being perfect, Walked with God in streets of gold. Love and virtue, faith and wisdom, Grace and gifts were all combined. As himself each loved his neighbor; All were one in heart and mind.</h4>
<h4>2. There they shunn’d the pow’r of Satan And observed celestial laws; For in Adam-ondi-Ahman Zion rose where Eden was. When beyond the pow’r of evil, So that none could covet wealth, One continual feast of blessings Crown’d their days with peace and health.</h4>
<h4>3. Then the tow’rs of Zion glittered Like the sun in yonder skies, And the wicked stood and trembled, Filled with wonder and surprise. Then their faith and works were perfect; Lo, they followed their great Head! So the city went to heaven, And the world said, “Zion’s fled!”</h4>
<h4>4. When the Lord returns with Zion, And we hear the watchman cry, Then we’ll surely be united, And we’ll all see eye to eye. Then we’ll mingle with the angels, And the Lord will bless his own. Then the earth will be as Eden, And we’ll know as we are known.</h4>

<h3>80. God of Our Fathers, Known of Old</h3>
<h4>1. God of our fathers, known of old, Lord of our far-flung battle line, Beneath whose awful hand we hold Dominion over palm and pine: Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget, lest we forget.</h4>
<h4>2. The tumult and the shouting dies; The captains and the kings depart. Still stands thine ancient sacrifice, An humble and a contrite heart. Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget, lest we forget.</h4>
<h4>3. Far-called, our navies melt away; On dune and headland sinks the fire. Lo, all our pomp of yesterday Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! Judge of the nations, spare us yet, Lest we forget, lest we forget.</h4>

<h3>106. God Speed the Right</h3>
<h4>1. Now to heav’n our prayer ascending, God speed the right; In a noble cause contending, God speed the right. Be our zeal in heav’n recorded, With success on earth rewarded. God speed the right. God speed the right.</h4>
<h4>2. Be that prayer again repeated, God speed the right; Ne’er despairing, though defeated, God speed the right. Like the great and good in story, If we fail, we fail with glory. God speed the right. God speed the right.</h4>
<h4>3. Patient, firm, and persevering, God speed the right; No event nor danger fearing, God speed the right. Pains, nor toils, nor trials heeding, And in heav’n’s good time succeeding, God speed the right. God speed the right.</h4>

<h4>2. When I am filled with strong desire And ask a boon of him, I see No miracle of living fire, But what I ask flows into me. And when the tempest rages high I feel no arm around me thrust, But ev’ry storm goes rolling by When I repose in him my trust.</h4>
<h4>3. It matters not what may befall, What threat’ning hand hangs over me; He is my rampart through it all, My refuge from mine enemy. Come unto him all ye depressed, Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim, Ye weary ones who long for rest. Come unto him! Come unto him!</h4>

<h3>136. I Know That My Redeemer Lives</h3>
<h4>1. I know that my Redeemer lives. What comfort this sweet sentence gives! He lives, he lives, who once was dead. He lives, my ever-living Head. He lives to bless me with his love. He lives to plead for me above. He lives my hungry soul to feed. He lives to bless in time of need.</h4>
<h4>2. He lives to grant me rich supply. He lives to guide me with his eye. He lives to comfort me when faint. He lives to hear my soul’s complaint. He lives to silence all my fears. He lives to wipe away my tears. He lives to calm my troubled heart. He lives all blessings to impart.</h4>
<h4>3. He lives, my kind, wise heav’nly Friend. He lives and loves me to the end. He lives, and while he lives, I’ll sing. He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King. He lives and grants me daily breath. He lives, and I shall conquer death. He lives my mansion to prepare. He lives to bring me safely there.</h4>
<h4>4. He lives! All glory to his name! He lives, my Savior, still the same. Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives: “I know that my Redeemer lives!” He lives! All glory to his name! He lives, my Savior, still the same. Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives: “I know that my Redeemer lives!”</h4>

<h3>137. Testimony</h3>
<h4>1. The witness of the Holy Ghost, As borne by those who know, Has lifted me again to thee, O Father of my soul.</h4>
<h4>2. I know that thou art in the heav’n. I know the Savior reigns. I know a prophet speaks to us For our eternal gain.</h4>
<h4>3. My eyes are wet; my heart is full. The Spirit speaks today. O Lord, wilt thou my life renew And in my bosom stay.</h4>
<h4>4. As testimony fills my heart, It dulls the pain of days. For one brief moment, heaven’s view Appears before my gaze.</h4>

<h3>140. Did You Think to Pray?</h3>
<h4>1. Ere you left your room this morning, Did you think to pray? In the name of Christ, our Savior, Did you sue for loving favor As a shield today?</h4>
<p>Oh, how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day. So, when life gets dark and dreary, Don’t forget to pray.</p>
<h4>2. When your heart was filled with anger, Did you think to pray? Did you plead for grace, my brother, That you might forgive another Who had crossed your way?</h4>

<h4>3. When sore trials came upon you, Did you think to pray? When your soul was full of sorrow, Balm of Gilead did you borrow At the gates of day?</h4>

<h4>1. There is an hour of peace and rest, Unmarred by earthly care; ’Tis when before the Lord I go And kneel in secret prayer.</h4>

<h3>145. Prayer Is the Soul’s Sincere Desire</h3>
<h4>1. Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire, Uttered or unexpressed, The motion of a hidden fire That trembles in the breast.</h4>
<h4>2. Prayer is the burden of a sigh, The falling of a tear, The upward glancing of an eye When none but God is near.</h4>
<h4>3. Prayer is the simplest form of speech That infant lips can try; Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach The Majesty on high.</h4>
<h4>4. Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath, The Christian’s native air, His watchword at the gates of death; He enters heav’n with prayer.</h4>
<h4>5. Prayer is the contrite sinner’s voice, Returning from his ways, While angels in their songs rejoice And cry, “Behold, he prays!”</h4>
<h4>6. The Saints in prayer appear as one In word and deed and mind, While with the Father and the Son Their fellowship they find.</h4>
<h4>7. Nor prayer is made on earth alone: The Holy Spirit pleads, And Jesus at the Father’s throne For sinners intercedes.</h4>
<h4>8. O thou by whom we come to God, The Life, the Truth, the Way! The path of prayer thyself hast trod; Lord, teach us how to pray.</h4>

<h4>1. Sweet is the work, my God, my King, To praise thy name, give thanks and sing, To show thy love by morning light, And talk of all thy truths at night.</h4>
<h4>2. Sweet is the day of sacred rest. No mortal care shall seize my breast. Oh, may my heart in tune be found, Like David’s harp of solemn sound!</h4>
<h4>3. My heart shall triumph in my Lord And bless his works and bless his word. Thy works of grace, how bright they shine! How deep thy counsels, how divine!</h4>
<h4>4. But, oh, what triumph shall I raise To thy dear name through endless days, When in the realms of joy I see Thy face in full felicity!</h4>
<h4>5. Sin, my worst enemy before, Shall vex my eyes and ears no more. My inward foes shall all be slain, Nor Satan break my peace again.</h4>
<h4>6. Then shall I see and hear and know All I desired and wished below, And every pow’r find sweet employ In that eternal world of joy.</h4>

<h4>1. Abide with me! fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens. Lord, with me abide! When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!</h4>
<h4>2. Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day. Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away. Change and decay in all around I see; O thou who changest not, abide with me!</h4>
<h4>3. I need thy presence ev’ry passing hour. What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s pow’r? Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be? Thru cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!</h4>

<h4>2. His precious blood he freely spilt; His life he freely gave, A sinless sacrifice for guilt, A dying world to save.</h4>
<h4>3. By strict obedience Jesus won The prize with glory rife: “Thy will, O God, not mine be done,” Adorned his mortal life.</h4>
<h4>4. He marked the path and led the way, And ev’ry point defines To light and life and endless day Where God’s full presence shines.</h4>
<h4>5. In mem’ry of the broken flesh We eat the broken bread And witness with the cup, afresh, Our faith in Christ, our Head.</h4>
<h4>6. How great, how glorious, how complete Redemption’s grand design, Where justice, love, and mercy meet In harmony divine!</h4>

<h3>196. Jesus, Once of Humble Birth</h3>
<h4>1. Jesus, once of humble birth, Now in glory comes to earth. Once he suffered grief and pain; Now he comes on earth to reign. Now he comes on earth to reign.</h4>
<h4>2. Once a meek and lowly Lamb, Now the Lord, the great I Am. Once upon the cross he bowed; Now his chariot is the cloud. Now his chariot is the cloud.</h4>
<h4>3. Once he groaned in blood and tears; Now in glory he appears. Once rejected by his own, Now their King he shall be known. Now their King he shall be known.</h4>
<h4>4. Once forsaken, left alone, Now exalted to a throne. Once all things he meekly bore, But he now will bear no more. But he now will bear no more.</h4>

<h2>Easter</h2>

<h3>197. O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown</h3>
<h4>1. O Savior, thou who wearest A crown of piercing thorn, The pain thou meekly bearest, Weigh’d down by grief and scorn. The soldiers mock and flail thee; For drink they give thee gall; Upon the cross they nail thee To die, O King of all.</h4>
<h4>2. No creature is so lowly, No sinner so depraved, But feels thy presence holy And thru thy love is saved. Tho craven friends betray thee, They feel thy love’s embrace; The very foes who slay thee Have access to thy grace.</h4>
<h4>3. Thy sacrifice transcended The mortal law’s demand; Thy mercy is extended To ev’ry time and land. No more can Satan harm us, Tho long the fight may be, Nor fear of death alarm us; We live, O Lord, thru thee.</h4>
<h4>4. What praises can we offer To thank thee, Lord most high? In our place thou didst suffer; In our place thou didst die, By heaven’s plan appointed, To ransom us, our King. O Jesus, the anointed, To thee our love we bring!</h4>

<h4>3. And in despair I bowed my head: “There is no peace on earth,” I said, “For hate is strong and mocks the song Of peace on earth, good will to men.”</h4>
<h4>4. Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: “God is not dead, nor doth he sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men.”</h4>

<h4>2. Seeds that fall amid the stillness Of the lonely mountain glen; Seeds cast out in crowded places, Trodden under foot of men; Seeds by idle hearts forgotten, Flung at random on the air; Seeds by faithful souls remembered, Sown in tears and love and prayer;</h4>
<h4>3. Seeds that lie unchanged, unquickened, Lifeless on the teeming mold; Seeds that live and grow and flourish When the sower’s hand is cold. By a whisper sow we blessings; By a breath we scatter strife. In our words and thoughts and actions Lie the seeds of death and life.</h4>
<h4>4. Thou who knowest all our weakness, Leave us not to sow alone! Bid thine angels guard the furrows Where the precious grain is sown, Till the fields are crown’d with glory, Filled with mellow, ripened ears, Filled with fruit of life eternal From the seed we sowed in tears.</h4>

<p>Out in the desert they wander, Hungry and helpless and cold; Off to the rescue he hastens, Bringing them back to the fold.</p>
<h4>2. Dear to the heart of the Shepherd, Dear are the lambs of his fold; Some from the pastures are straying, Hungry and helpless and cold. See, the Good Shepherd is seeking, Seeking the lambs that are lost, Bringing them in with rejoicing, Saved at such infinite cost.</h4>
<p>Out in the desert they wander, Hungry and helpless and cold; Off to the rescue he hastens, Bringing them back to the fold.</p>
<h4>3. Dear to the heart of the Shepherd, Dear are the “ninety and nine”; Dear are the sheep that have wandered Out in the desert to pine. Hark! he is earnestly calling, Tenderly pleading today: “Will you not seek for my lost ones, Off from my shelter astray?”</h4>
<p>Out in the desert they wander, Hungry and helpless and cold; Off to the rescue he hastens, Bringing them back to the fold.</p>
<h4>4. Green are the pastures inviting; Sweet are the waters and still. Lord, we will answer thee gladly, “Yes, blessed Master, we will! Make us thy true under-shepherds; Give us a love that is deep. Send us out into the desert, Seeking thy wandering sheep.”</h4>
<p>Out in the desert they wander, Hungry and helpless and cold; Off to the rescue we’ll hasten, Bringing them back to the fold.</p>

<h4>1. I have work enough to do, Ere the sun goes down, For myself and kindred too, Ere the sun goes down: Ev’ry idle whisper stilling With a purpose firm and willing, All my daily tasks fulfilling, Ere the sun goes down.</h4>
<h4>2. I must speak the loving word, Ere the sun goes down. I must let my voice be heard, Ere the sun goes down: Ev’ry cry of pity heeding, For the injured interceding, To the light the lost ones leading, Ere the sun goes down.</h4>
<h4>3. As I journey on my way, Ere the sun goes down, God’s commands I must obey, Ere the sun goes down. There are sins that need confessing; There are wrongs that need redressing If I would obtain the blessing, Ere the sun goes down.</h4>

<h3>225. We Are Marching On to Glory</h3>
<h4>1. We are marching on to glory; We are working for our crown. We will make our armor brighter And never lay it down.</h4>
<p>We are marching, marching homeward To that bright land afar. We work for life eternal; It is our guiding star.</p>
<h4>2. Then day by day we are marching; To heaven we are bound. Each good act brings us nearer That home where we’ll be crowned.</h4>
<p>We are marching, marching homeward To that bright land afar. We work for life eternal; It is our guiding star.</p>
<h4>3. Then, with the ransomed children That throng the starry throne, We will praise our Lord and Savior, His pow’r and mercy own.</h4>

<h3>226. Improve the Shining Moments</h3>
<h4>1. Improve the shining moments; Don’t let them pass you by. Work while the sun is radiant; Work, for the night draws nigh. We cannot bid the sunbeams To lengthen out their stay, Nor can we ask the shadow To ever stay away.</h4>
<h4>2. Time flies on wings of lightning; We cannot call it back. It comes, then passes forward Along its onward track. And if we are not mindful, The chance will fade away, For life is quick in passing. ’Tis as a single day.</h4>
<h4>3. As wintertime doth follow The pleasant summer days, So may our joys all vanish And pass far from our gaze. Then should we not endeavor Each day some point to gain, That we may here be useful And ev’ry wrong disdain?</h4>
<h4>4. Improve each shining moment. In this you are secure, For promptness bringeth safety And blessings rich and pure. Let prudence guide your actions; Be honest in your heart; And God will love and bless you And help to you impart.</h4>

<h3>233. Nay, Speak No Ill</h3>
<h4>1. Nay, speak no ill; a kindly word Can never leave a sting behind; And, oh, to breathe each tale we’ve heard Is far beneath a noble mind. Full oft a better seed is sown By choosing thus the kinder plan, For, if but little good is known, Still let us speak the best we can.</h4>
<h4>2. Give me the heart that fain would hide, Would fain another’s faults efface. How can it please the human pride To prove humanity but base? No, let us reach a higher mood, A nobler estimate of man; Be earnest in the search for good, And speak of all the best we can.</h4>
<h4>3. Then speak no ill, but lenient be To others’ failings as your own. If you’re the first a fault to see, Be not the first to make it known, For life is but a passing day; No lip may tell how brief its span. Then, oh, the little time we stay, Let’s speak of all the best we can.</h4>

<h3>272. Oh Say, What Is Truth?</h3>
<h4>1. Oh say, what is truth? ’Tis the fairest gem That the riches of worlds can produce, And priceless the value of truth will be when The proud monarch’s costliest diadem Is counted but dross and refuse.</h4>
<h4>2. Yes, say, what is truth? ’Tis the brightest prize To which mortals or Gods can aspire. Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies: ’Tis an aim for the noblest desire.</h4>
<h4>3. The sceptre may fall from the despot’s grasp When with winds of stern justice he copes. But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast And the wreck of the fell tyrant’s hopes.</h4>
<h4>4. Then say, what is truth? ’Tis the last and the first, For the limits of time it steps o’er. Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst, Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, Eternal, unchanged, evermore.</h4>

<h3>273. Truth Reflects upon Our Senses</h3>
<h4>1. Truth reflects upon our senses; Gospel light reveals to some. If there still should be offenses, Woe to them by whom they come! Judge not, that ye be not judged, Was the counsel Jesus gave; Measure given, large or grudged, Just the same you must receive.</h4>
<p>Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us, Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forevermore.</p>
<h4>2. Jesus said, “Be meek and lowly,” For ’tis high to be a judge; If I would be pure and holy, I must love without a grudge. It requires a constant labor All his precepts to obey. If I truly love my neighbor, I am in the narrow way.</h4>
<p>Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us, Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forevermore.</p>
<h4>3. Once I said unto another, “In thine eye there is a mote; If thou art a friend, a brother, Hold, and let me pull it out.” But I could not see it fairly, For my sight was very dim. When I came to search more clearly, In mine eye there was a beam.</h4>
<p>Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us, Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forevermore.</p>
<h4>4. If I love my brother dearer, And his mote I would erase, Then the light should shine the clearer, For the eye’s a tender place. Others I have oft reproved For an object like a mote; Now I wish this beam removed; Oh, that tears would wash it out!</h4>
<p>Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us, Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forevermore.</p>
<h4>5. Charity and love are healing; These will give the clearest sight; When I saw my brother’s failing, I was not exactly right. Now I’ll take no further trouble; Jesus’ love is all my theme; Little motes are but a bubble When I think upon the beam.</h4>
<p>Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us, Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forevermore.</p>

<h3>274. The Iron Rod</h3>
<h4>1. To Nephi, seer of olden time, A vision came from God, Wherein the holy word sublime Was shown an iron rod.</h4>
<p>Hold to the rod, the iron rod; ’Tis strong, and bright, and true. The iron rod is the word of God; ’Twill safely guide us through.</p>
<h4>2. While on our journey here below, Beneath temptation’s pow’r, Through mists of darkness we must go, In peril ev’ry hour.</h4>
<p>Hold to the rod, the iron rod; ’Tis strong, and bright, and true. The iron rod is the word of God; ’Twill safely guide us through.</p>
<h4>3. And when temptation’s pow’r is nigh, Our pathway clouded o’er, Upon the rod we can rely, And heaven’s aid implore.</h4>
<p>Hold to the rod, the iron rod; ’Tis strong, and bright, and true. The iron rod is the word of God; ’Twill safely guide us through.</p>
<h4>4. And, hand o’er hand, the rod along, Through each succeeding day, With earnest prayer and hopeful song, We’ll still pursue our way.</h4>
<p>Hold to the rod, the iron rod; ’Tis strong, and bright, and true. The iron rod is the word of God; ’Twill safely guide us through.</p>
<h4>5. Afar we see the golden rest To which the rod will guide, Where, with the angels bright and blest, Forever we’ll abide.</h4>
<p>Hold to the rod, the iron rod; ’Tis strong, and bright, and true. The iron rod is the word of God; ’Twill safely guide us through.</p>

<h3>275. Men Are That They Might Have Joy</h3>
<h4>1. A voice hath spoken from the dust, Its message pure, without alloy, Of treasured hope and sacred trust: Oh, “men are that they might have joy.”</h4>
<h4>2. Should sorrow come, we’ll not despair, For He would not that men should pine. The grief that comes we’ll learn to bear Until again the sun doth shine.</h4>

<h3>276. Come Away to the Sunday School</h3>
<h4>1. When the rosy light of morning Softly beams above the hill, And the birds, sweet heav’nly songsters, Ev’ry dell with music fill, Fresh from slumber we awaken; Sunshine chases clouds away. Nature breathes her sweetest fragrance On the holy Sabbath day.</h4>
<p>Then away, haste away! Come away to the Sunday School! Then away, do not delay! Come away to the Sunday School!</p>
<h4>2. For a good and glorious purpose Thus we meet each Sabbath day, Each one striving for salvation Thru the Lord’s appointed way. Earnest toil will be rewarded; Zealous hearts need not repine. God will not withhold his blessings From the eager, seeking mind.</h4>
<p>Then away, haste away! Come away to the Sunday School! Then away, do not delay! Come away to the Sunday School!</p>
<h4>3. Let us then press boldly onward, Prove ourselves as soldiers true. He will lead us; he will guide us. Come, there’s work for all to do, Never tiring, never doubting, Boldly struggling to the end. In the world, tho foes assail us, God will surely be our friend.</h4>

<h4>3. And we for them can be baptized, Yes, for our friends most dear, That they can with the just be raised When Gabriel’s trump they hear; That they may come with Christ again When he to earth descends, A thousand years with him to reign, And with their earthly friends.</h4>
<h4>4. Now, O ye Saints, rejoice today That you can saviors be Of all your dead who will obey The gospel and be free. Then let us rise without restraint And act for those we love, For they are giving their consent And wait for us to move.</h4>

<h4>2. For a wise and glorious purpose Thou hast placed me here on earth And withheld the recollection Of my former friends and birth; Yet ofttimes a secret something Whispered, “You’re a stranger here,” And I felt that I had wandered From a more exalted sphere.</h4>
<h4>3. I had learned to call thee Father, Thru thy Spirit from on high, But, until the key of knowledge Was restored, I knew not why. In the heav’ns are parents single? No, the thought makes reason stare! Truth is reason; truth eternal Tells me I’ve a mother there.</h4>

<h3>296. Our Father, by Whose Name</h3>
<h4>1. Our Father, by whose name all fatherhood is known, Who dost in love proclaim each family thine own, Bless thou all parents, guarding well, With constant love as sentinel, The homes in which thy people dwell.</h4>
<h4>2. As thou thy Child didst fill with wisdom, love, and might, To know and do thy will and teach thy ways aright, Our children bless, in ev’ry place, That they may all behold thy face, And, knowing thee, may grow in grace.</h4>
<h4>3. May thy strong Spirit bind our hearts in unity, And help us each to find the love from self set free. In all our hearts such love increase, That ev’ry home, by this release, May be the dwelling place of peace.</h4>

<h3>297. From Homes of Saints Glad Songs Arise</h3>
<h4>1. From homes of Saints glad songs arise, For there the Lord is King. There faith is learned and prayers ascend, The Spirit’s peace to bring. For homes where scriptures old are loved, And living prophets, too, All thanks we give; the Father praise For guidance sure and true.</h4>
<h4>2. God’s truths protect the hearth from wrong When error’s ways allure, Lift minds from self to nobleness, Keep thought and action pure. Then sing, O Saints, in hymns of praise; Sing thanks to God on high, Whose counsels kept in homes on earth Bring heaven’s glory nigh.</h4>

<h4>2. Drawing fam’ly near each week, We’ll keep love burning bright. Serving Him with cheerful hearts, We’ll grow in truth and light. Parents teach and lead the way, Children honor and obey, Reaching for our home in heaven, Where we want to stay.</h4>
<h4>3. Praying daily in our home, We’ll feel His love divine; Searching scriptures faithfully, We’ll nourish heart and mind. Singing hymns of thanks, we’ll say, “Father, help us find the way Leading to our home in heaven, Where we long to stay.”</h4>

<h3>326. Come, Come, Ye Saints</h3>
<h4>1. Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear; But with joy wend your way. Though hard to you this journey may appear, Grace shall be as your day. ’Tis better far for us to strive Our useless cares from us to drive; Do this, and joy your hearts will swell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>2. Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard? ’Tis not so; all is right. Why should we think to earn a great reward If we now shun the fight? Gird up your loins; fresh courage take. Our God will never us forsake; And soon we’ll have this tale to tell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>3. We’ll find the place which God for us prepared, Far away in the West, Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; There the Saints will be blessed. We’ll make the air with music ring, Shout praises to our God and King; Above the rest these words we’ll tell— All is well! All is well!</h4>
<h4>4. And should we die before our journey’s through, Happy day! All is well! We then are free from toil and sorrow, too; With the just we shall dwell! But if our lives are spared again To see the Saints their rest obtain, Oh, how we’ll make this chorus swell— All is well! All is well!</h4>

<h3>327. Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven</h3>
<h4>1. Go, ye messengers of heaven, Chosen by divine command; Go and publish free salvation To a dark, benighted land.</h4>
<h4>2. Go to island, vale, and mountain; There fulfill the great command; Gather out the sons of Jacob To possess the promised land.</h4>
<h4>3. When your thousands all are gathered, And their prayers for you ascend, And the Lord has crowned with blessings All the labors of your hand,</h4>
<h4>4. Then the song of joy and transport Will from ev’ry land resound; Then the nations long in darkness By the Savior will be crowned.</h4>

<h3>328. An Angel from on High</h3>
<h4>1. An angel from on high The long, long silence broke; Descending from the sky, These gracious words he spoke: Lo! in Cumorah’s lonely hill A sacred record lies concealed. Lo! in Cumorah’s lonely hill A sacred record lies concealed.</h4>
<h4>2. Sealed by Moroni’s hand, It has for ages lain To wait the Lord’s command, From dust to speak again. It shall again to light come forth To usher in Christ’s reign on earth. It shall again to light come forth To usher in Christ’s reign on earth.</h4>
<h4>3. It speaks of Joseph’s seed And makes the remnant known Of nations long since dead, Who once had dwelt alone. The fulness of the gospel, too, Its pages will reveal to view. The fulness of the gospel, too, Its pages will reveal to view.</h4>
<h4>4. The time is now fulfilled, The long-expected day; Let earth obedience yield And darkness flee away. Remove the seals; be wide unfurled Its light and glory to the world. Remove the seals; be wide unfurled Its light and glory to the world.</h4>
<h4>5. Lo! Israel filled with joy Shall now be gathered home, Their wealth and means employ To build Jerusalem, While Zion shall arise and shine And fill the earth with truth divine. While Zion shall arise and shine And fill the earth with truth divine.</h4>

<h3>329. Thy Servants Are Prepared</h3>
<h4>1. Thy servants are prepared To teach thy word abroad, To gather in thy sheep To thee, O Lamb of God.</h4>
<h4>2. Let these, thy servants, speak With heart and voice of youth, And fill the world’s dark lamps With light, the flame of truth.</h4>
<h4>3. In all of Zion’s stakes Thy love shall conquer night, While darkness draws away From thy revealing light.</h4>

<h3>330. See, the Mighty Angel Flying</h3>
<h4>1. See, the mighty angel flying; See, he speeds his way to earth To proclaim the blessed gospel And restore the ancient faith, And restore, and restore the ancient faith.</h4>
<h4>2. Hear, O men, the proclamation; Cease from vanity and strife. Hasten to receive the gospel And obey the words of life, And obey, and obey the words of life.</h4>
<h4>3. Soon the earth will hear the warning; Then the judgments will descend! Oh, before the days of sorrow, Make the Lord of Hosts your friend! Make the Lord, make the Lord of Hosts your friend!</h4>
<h4>4. Then when dangers are around you And the wicked are distressed, You, with all the Saints of Zion, Shall enjoy eternal rest, Shall enjoy, shall enjoy eternal rest.</h4>

<h3>331. Oh Say, What Is Truth?</h3>
<h4>1. Oh say, what is truth? ’Tis the fairest gem That the riches of worlds can produce, And priceless the value of truth will be when The proud monarch’s costliest diadem Is counted but dross and refuse.</h4>
<h4>2. Yes, say, what is truth? ’Tis the brightest prize To which mortals or Gods can aspire. Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies: ’Tis an aim for the noblest desire.</h4>
<h4>3. The sceptre may fall from the despot’s grasp When with winds of stern justice he copes. But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast And the wreck of the fell tyrant’s hopes.</h4>
<h4>4. Then say, what is truth? ’Tis the last and the first, For the limits of time it steps o’er. Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst, Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, Eternal, unchanged, evermore.</h4>

<h3>332. Come, O Thou King of Kings</h3>
<h4>1. Come, O thou King of Kings! We’ve waited long for thee, With healing in thy wings, To set thy people free. Come, thou desire of nations, come; Let Israel now be gathered home.</h4>
<h4>2. Come, make an end to sin, And cleanse the earth by fire, And righteousness bring in, That Saints may tune the lyre With songs of joy, a happier strain, To welcome in thy peaceful reign.</h4>
<h4>3. Hosannas now shall sound From all the ransomed throng, And glory echo round A new triumphal song; The wide expanse of heaven fill With anthems sweet from Zion’s hill.</h4>
<h4>4. Hail! Prince of life and peace! Thrice welcome to thy throne! While all the chosen race Their Lord and Savior own, The heathen nations bow the knee, And ev’ry tongue sounds praise to thee.</h4>

<h3>333. High on the Mountain Top</h3>
<h4>1. High on the mountain top A banner is unfurled. Ye nations, now look up; It waves to all the world. In Deseret’s sweet, peaceful land, On Zion’s mount behold it stand!</h4>
<h4>2. For God remembers still His promise made of old That he on Zion’s hill Truth’s standard would unfold! Her light should there attract the gaze Of all the world in latter days.</h4>
<h4>3. His house shall there be reared, His glory to display, And people shall be heard In distant lands to say: We’ll now go up and serve the Lord, Obey his truth and learn his word.</h4>
<h4>4. For there we shall be taught The law that will go forth, With truth and wisdom fraught, To govern all the earth. Forever there his ways we’ll tread, And save ourselves with all our dead.</h4>

<h4>3. I need thee every hour, In joy or pain. Come quickly and abide, Or life is vain.</h4>

<h3>335. Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy</h3>
<h4>1. Brightly beams our Father’s mercy From his lighthouse evermore, But to us he gives the keeping Of the lights along the shore.</h4>
<p>Let the lower lights be burning; Send a gleam across the wave. Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save.</p>
<h4>2. Dark the night of sin has settled; Loud the angry billows roar. Eager eyes are watching, longing, For the lights along the shore.</h4>
<p>Let the lower lights be burning; Send a gleam across the wave. Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save.</p>
<h4>3. Trim your feeble lamp, my brother; Some poor sailor, tempest-tossed, Trying now to make the harbor, In the darkness may be lost.</h4>
<p>Let the lower lights be burning; Send a gleam across the wave. Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save.</p>

<h3>336. School Thy Feelings</h3>
<h4>1. School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control. School thy feelings; there is power In the cool, collected mind. Passion shatters reason’s tower, Makes the clearest vision blind.</h4>
<p>School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control.</p>
<h4>2. School thy feelings; condemnation Never pass on friend or foe, Though the tide of accusation Like a flood of truth may flow. Hear defense before deciding, And a ray of light may gleam, Showing thee what filth is hiding Underneath the shallow stream.</h4>
<p>School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control.</p>
<h4>3. Should affliction’s acrid vial Burst o’er thy unsheltered head, School thy feelings to the trial; Half its bitterness hath fled. Art thou falsely, basely, slandered? Does the world begin to frown? Gauge thy wrath by wisdom’s standard; Keep thy rising anger down.</h4>
<p>School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control.</p>
<h4>4. Rest thyself on this assurance: Time’s a friend to innocence, And the patient, calm endurance Wins respect and aids defense. Noblest minds have finest feelings; Quiv’ring strings a breath can move; And the gospel’s sweet revealings Tune them with the key of love.</h4>
<p>School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control.</p>
<h4>5. Hearts so sensitively molded Strongly fortified should be, Trained to firmness and enfolded In a calm tranquility. Wound not willfully another; Conquer haste with reason’s might; School thy feelings, sister, brother; Train them in the path of right.</h4>
<p>School thy feelings, O my brother; Train thy warm, impulsive soul. Do not its emotions smother, But let wisdom’s voice control.</p>

<h3>337. O Home Beloved</h3>
<h4>1. O home belov’d, where’er I wander, On foreign land or distant sea, As time rolls by, my heart grows fonder And yearns more lovingly for thee! Tho fair be nature’s scenes around me, And friends are ever kind and true, Tho joyous mirth and song surround me, My heart, my soul still yearn for you.</h4>
<h4>2. The flow’rs around me may be fairer Than those that bloom upon thy hills; The streams, great, mighty treasure bearers, More noted may be than thy rills. No world renown my humble village Like these great towns may proudly claim; Yet my fond heart doth thrill with rapture Whene’er I hear thy humble name.</h4>
<h4>3. Ye valleys fair and snowcapped mountains, Ye peaceful hamlets ’mid the trees, Ye murm’ring streams and crystal fountains, Kissed by the cool, soft, balmy breeze, Words cannot tell how well I love thee Nor speak my longing when I roam. My heart alone can cry to heaven, “God bless my own dear mountain home.”</h4>

<h3>340. The Star-Spangled Banner</h3>
<h4>1. Oh say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there. Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</h4>
<h4>2. On the shore, dimly seen thru the mists of the deep, Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, In full glory reflected now shines on the stream; ’Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</h4>
<h4>3. Oh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation! Blest with vict’ry and peace, may the heav’n-rescued land Praise the Pow’r that hath made and preserved us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: “In God is our trust!” And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</h4>
